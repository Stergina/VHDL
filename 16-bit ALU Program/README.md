# 16-bit ALU in VHDL


**Objective**:  
The aim of this project is to design a hierarchical circuit that will implement a 16-bit Numerical and Logic Unit - ALU in VHDL.

**Structure of the code**:  
In the first part, we design and implement a 1-bit ALU, while in the second part we will implement a 16-bit ALU using the 1-bit ALU of the first part as a component.
